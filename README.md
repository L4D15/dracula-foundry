# Dracula Theme
My take on the open theme [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) and [Dracula UI](https://draculatheme.com/ui) for Foundry VTT. The module will likely remain relatively inactive.

Does not play well with systems that use a lot of system specific theming. D&D 5e will have the most support/integration due to it being my main system.

I'm also publishing this as a foundation / skeleton for anyone else who wants to dip into modifying Foundry into a darker UI or experimenting with the Foundry UI. TyphonJS, who helped me with a significant portion of this, is making his own theme with Dracula as a foundation with dynamic colour theming, palettes, and other colour-based additions.

If you see something off, let me know and I'll see what I can do.

# Development

This module uses a simple webpack setup to develop and test the module easily. Navigate to the repository folder and call `npm install` to install all required packages. Then you can call `npm run build` to generate the project into a `.zip` file to distribute it. If you would prefer to test changes as you work in the module, configure the abosulte path to your FoundryVTT data folder in `foundryconfig.json` and call `npm run build:dev`, this will automatically copy the generated module into your FoundryVTT modules folder everytime you modify any file in the project (remember to refresh Foundry to load the new changes).
